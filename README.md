# Web-API-in-ASP.NET-Core

- Add 3 entities with at least 5 attributes, not counting the ID.
- Add storage to a database and migrations.
- Add a `1 to many` and a `many to many` (added as a separate entity containing the two related entities or their IDs and at least 2 additional attributes) relation between two entities. 
- Add `CRUD` for all entities.
- Implement filtering on a numeric field for at least one entity. The filtering should return all entities with the numeric field higher than a given value.
- Add a statistical report involving two entities (you probably want to use a `DTO` class for this).
- Create a UML diagram for your application and a database diagram for your database.
